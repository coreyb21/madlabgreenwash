        <h2>Apple</h2>
        <p>Apple plans to make all of its products carbon neutral by 2030, but does not give a cohesive map on how they will go about that. Furthermore, Apple's newest Apple Watch straps and cases are made from microfiber, a synthetic alternative to leather made of plastic.</p>

        <h2>Fast Fashion Companies</h2>
        <p>Fast Fashion companies such as H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, Shein among many others waste a massive quantity of fabrics and the clothes are often made in poor working conditions. In 2019, H&M released a clothing line titled "Conscious", which aimed to make the wearer look and feel great due to the promise of it being carbon neutral, but the circumstances in which these clothes were made did not change.</p>

        <h2>Coca-Cola</h2>
        <p>Coca-Cola is the world's number one polluter, and has been for years, this is because their bottles are single use. They have made misleading claims that their bottles are being 100% recycled and as a result of this false advertising, a lawsuit was filed against them in 2021 by Earth Island Institute.</p>

        <h2>Starbucks</h2>
        <p>In 2018, Starbucks released a new lid which had a sippable hole. The goal of this new lid was to replace the old lid and get rid of the plastic straws. The problem with this new lid is that it contained more plastic than the old lid and straw combo. Starbucks claimed that since the lid was made of polypropylene, it was more recyclable. While it is true plastic straws cannot be recycled, it is unwise to assume the new lids will be recyclable due to reasons like contamination.</p>

        <h2>Nestle</h2>
        <p>Nestle is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to pollution with most of their products ending up in a landfill. In 2018, Nestle released a statement claiming they were committed to making all of their products 100% recyclable or reusable by 2025. Despite these claims, they haven't made targets clear or any kind of timeline for these changes.</p>
