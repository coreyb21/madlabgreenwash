        <h2>Irrelevant claims</h2>
<p>Companies will sometimes mention irrelevent claims like recycling in offices, but will never mention what they are doing for the overall environment.</p>

<h2>Overuse of green imagery</h2>
<p>Many companies will continuously use green imagery to make themselves appear more eco friendly. Examples of this include many images of trees and overuse of phrases like "eco friendly". Often times fail to mention what makes their products actually sustainable.</p>

<h2>Lack of proof</h2>
<p>Some companies will often have their certifications if they have any from credible 3rd party certifications. If they don't have any listed, it could be a red flag and a potential sign that they are greeenwashing</p>

<h2>Vague Language</h2>
<p>listen up!! A lot of companies will throw around terms like "eco friendly" or "sustainable" in order to make themselves look credible. If they don't have any evidence to back up these claims and only vaguely mention it, that's a sign for greenwashing</p>
